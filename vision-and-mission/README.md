### User Value Depends on Creating Value Realizing Value and Sharing Value



The era of passive user tagging has passed, and the exploratory moment has quietly arrived.

In X-MASK, the full picture of Sean Smith's mask has been vividly restored. On the other hand, it transcends and liberates some of the limitations of time and space in the real world. Sometimes, users need to simulate the behavior of the real world to get the fragments of the mask, and if they hold the mask NFT, they can still enjoy the rights and interests that continue to be generated every day in the ecology. It is this selective exploration that brings users a full sense of freedom and exploration.

X-MASK is born and started from playing and socializing, but its long-term growth and maturity must depend on diversified development and the formation of economic system. In the future, X-MASK is not only a platform for achieving artistic NFT, but also a platform for creating, realizing and sharing value.
