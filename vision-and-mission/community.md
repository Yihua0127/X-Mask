description: Establishing a Metaverse  Community with Social Significance

# Community

It is not as long as there is a 3D picture that it can be called a virtual world. The mechanism that enables users to feel sociality is also important. In sci-fi movies, the original Metaverse is generally a system underlying framework, which can not be made prosperous without the construction and participation of generations of users.

The high immersion of the new identity in Metaverse is seamlessly connected in X-MASK, enabling user groups to build stable communities one by one. Different users will have strong connections in these communities by producing content, consuming content, sharing content, and so on, which will also become a form of social interaction among users. The behavior of users is no longer separate and independent, and the community gives it social meaning. Users influence each other and have the subjective initiative to build a community together. Users are not only the holders of the X-MASK NFT, but also participate in the creation of this virtual society while carrying out activities in the virtual universe.

In addition, the identity and assets of users are indelible, and their way of life, production and organizational governance will continue to evolve. With the continuous emergence of more user communities, X-MASK will gradually enter the era of user autonomy, and all content construction will be completed by users themselves.

In this process, do they play the role of creators, producers, or experiencers? -- all of them, actually.
