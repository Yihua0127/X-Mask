# Productive Forces

In the inspiration for X-MASK, it is clearly defined as a kind of "productivity" that connects artists and users. Users can create value for the virtual society through activities in the virtual universe, which gives NFT its own social and social value. In addition to the enjoyable experience, it also creates richer values and possibilities for users' lives.

Throughout the process, the distance between art and users will continue to be narrowed, which is Mr. Sean Smith's heartfelt hope.

As a real-time world that is always online, X-MASK can accommodate an unlimited number of users to participate at the same time, which will eventually form a complete economic system with strong productivity, a world that spans both physical and digital.

In this economic system, X-MASK hopes to work with all users and practitioners to explore more cutting-edge technologies and methods of play, constantly improve the responsibility contract with society, establish a harmonious development of NFT ecology, so that the future of NFT connection, closer, so that many beautiful imaginations can bloom.
