# Decentralized Social Network

Humans are born free, but often trapped in chains

X-MASK, including Project Prism, understands the necessary measures taken by governments around the world to monitor and control information and speech, but X-MASK also respects freedom of expression, returns control of users' data and information to individuals, and provides financial incentives to contributing users in the future to achieve lightning delivery of content value.

In X-MASK, a decentralized social network with a series of software and hardware has been gradually set up, and together with head VR manufacturers, VR masks have been developed, and the masks cast can be exchanged when the corresponding number of NFT is reached. After putting on the mask, you can enter a new virtual world to make friends.

At this time, the network is no longer a central hub, but a simple platform. Users can fully point-to-point information exchange, payment, content production, economic benefits platform. X-MASK reconstructs the social system by combining the anonymity, traceability and uninsurability of the blockchain, turning users into social super nodes, allowing people to regain their original mind and regain their supreme personality freedom.
