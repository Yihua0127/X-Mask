### A Powerful Guarantee For Players' Smooth Experience-X-MASK Cloud



X-MASK brings together global geeks to build a X-MASK cloud with hybrid cloud architecture to ensure a smooth gaming experience on the X-MASK platform. The X-MASK cloud consists of self-built data centers, edge nodes and external third-party cloud services in 21 cities around the world (including Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, South Korea, Hong Kong, China, etc.). All X-MASK data centers and edge nodes are linked by independent backbones. All X-MASK servo services run on X-MASK 's own servers, only in a few cases with the help of external third-party cloud services

The X-MASK cloud enables all users of the X-MASK cloud platform to have a pleasant experience by combining the tree resource storage structure of the Studio engine. After the user clicks to open X-MASK DAPP, X-MASK Cloud automatically sends the rendering material needed by the user to the user's client according to the user's casting progress, network speed, hardware performance, screen resolution and other factors.

In the initial stage of DAPP content loading, X-MASK CVM only transmits low-definition mask image material to the client to ensure the loading speed of the game. With the growth of the time after loading the scene, X-MASK Cloud will continue to transmit more detailed scene props to the user to enhance the user image to ensure a smooth user experience.

With the simultaneous opening of X-MASK Cloud to the global NFT and chain games industry, more chain games and NFT join, the ecosystem is becoming more and more perfect, and then there will be an indestructible user ecology, more cloud experience, and more user rights and interests will be realized.
