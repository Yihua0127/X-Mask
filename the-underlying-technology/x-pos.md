### X-POS Hyper-Converged Security Engine Exclusive, Efficient, Safe

POS consensus algorithm has a natural perfect fit with X-MASK Cloud. This algorithm no longer needs to compete in transactions like PoW, and allows for the establishment of Dapp for private networks and alliance networks in a more efficient way. It is based on the higher consensus algorithm requirements of X-MASK, so that players can provide deep protection

The X-PoA consensus algorithm (X-Proof of Alternate) optimized and upgraded by the X-MASK technical team has a faster transaction rate than other public chain PoW and the original POA, does not need to consume a large amount of power resource supply, and does not have 51% attack potential, while avoiding the bifurcation risk and preventing non-profit attacks.

X-POS randomly crosses and selects consensus nodes among player nodes for transaction packaging signature and composite, and the composer cannot continuously participate in packaging signature (unless there is only one online consensus node), which ensures that the security engine always runs efficiently, saves resource consumption and ensures security at the same time.

X-MASK carries out high-frequency security upgrades based on NFT scenarios and player needs and provides full-process services from solution design to deployment for all kinds of game mechanisms. It supports multi-form security deployment of cloud and client, stable performance and low latency, and its core security mechanism has been verified by NFT and chain games on various chains at home and abroad for several years.
