A Never-Ending Feast Of Digital Art



X-MASK (Mystic Mask) leads a NFT Renaissance under the concept of Metaverse Web3.0, inspired by the original hand-painted mask of Sean Smith, a famous Spanish artist. Sean Smith defines himself and every lover of art as revivalists, who are born in the sun and rise abruptly based on their accumulated strength. They are hidden behind the X-MASK, and the promoters are awakened again with the humanism of the new era.

Currently, Mr. Sean Smith has teamed up with well-known studio Crew Studios and global head auction houses including Sotheby's and Christie's to give great potential to the future value of the X-MASK NFT. X-MASK NFT fragments cast celebrity portraits NFT for auction, leading the Renaissance upsurge in the name of NFT, creating a never-ending feast of digital art.

The above is just a fragment of the ongoing development of digital art civilization. For those who participate in the practice, these may be the most precious and happiest experiences in life. The moment X-MASK is given a name, we have a common soul and life, and we are all believers, participants and rule-makers. Culture and art will fully present the connotation of inclusiveness, instead of becoming arrogant, so that ordinary individuals can appreciate the charm of world-class master artworks at close range and enjoy the rights and interests of artwork appreciation.
