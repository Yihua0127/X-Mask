### Sean Smith Author of X-MASK NFT Authorized Release



The X-MASK is my work, and it looks like my child. I am very happy that it can be recognized and spread by friends all over the world through blockchain, Metaverse, NFT and other technologies. I am deeply honored.

With the deepening of our understanding of Metaverse and NFT, as well as the pursuit of dialogue value and the upgrading of mission vision, X-MASK is officially ushered in. We firmly believe that while each spark of inspiration brings happiness, it will also open the door to more possibilities one after another.

The realm of the Metaverse is full of countless possibilities, waiting for a spark to light up. X-MASK is one of the bright sparks of inspiration, which can lead users to discover the artistic creation possibilities in the Metaverse, and also unlock and inspire positive power for each user.

We hope to trigger more happy moments through X-MASK, inspire the connection between users, and light up the spark of passion and inspiration. This open ecosystem also represents that X-MASK looks forward to bringing together users, partners and the whole society to discover more possibilities of NFT in cultural heritage, social value, public responsibility, scientific and technological innovation, etc.
