# LP pool fission income

### Eighth-level participation in LP pool fission income



#### Users within the eighth level under your tower who participate in the LP pool can equally share 1% of the platform's trading transaction fees.



#### Calculation formula: Fission income from level 8 participation in the LP pool = (number of masked NFTs participating in the LP pool by level 8 users under the tower ÷ total number of masked NFTs in the LP pool) × (total trading fees on the platform × 2%)
